title: Plotting in R
---

One of R's strengths is its support for rich graphics and plotting capabilities.  There are several built-in plotting functions that can be very powerful.  There are also many packages that extend R to provide more specialized data visualization capabilities.  The following pages document different plotting features of R.  Beginners should start with the base package methods.  Then you can branch out into ggplot2, plotly, or more exotic plotting packages.  The data visualization capabilities in R far exceed those available in Tableau.  However, these capabilities can be hard to find and unlock in R, making Tableau easier for beginners to use.
