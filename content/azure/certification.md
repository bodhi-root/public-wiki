## Certifications

Microsoft offers several certifications related to Azure technology.  The complete list can be viewed here:

The ones that look most promising are:

### Azure Fundamentals

* Exam: AZ-900  ([Certification info](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/azure-fundamentals.aspx)  -  [Online material](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/))
* Completed: 9/20/2019

The online material for this course provides a good overview of Azure.  It says it takes 9 hours, but you can do it in 4-6.  However, I doubt that I would have passed the test just using the online material.  We took the exam as part of our Data Engineering training.  The course instructor helped prep us with sample questions and emphasizing topics that would be on the test (like different types of support and subscriptions).  I don't think this exam really demonstrates proficiency with Azure.  It was more focused on minutia and trivial matters like "what level of support do you need to open a support ticket?" and "where do you go to enter a support ticket?".  Recommendation: go through the online coursework, but don't bother with the exam (unless it's offered for free).

## Azure Data Engineer

* Exams: DP-200 & DP-201  ([Certification info](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/azure-data-engineer.aspx)  -  [Online material](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?products=azure&resource_type=learning%20path&roles=data-engineer))
* Completed: 9/26/2019

My company sponsored a few member of our team to attend this in-person training.  The training was great.  We walked through how to create storage accounts (Blob and ADLS Gen 2), SQL databases, SQL Data Warehouses, Cosmos DB, Event Hubs, and use ADF and Stream Analytics for ETL.  The coursework covering the DP-200 exam was 3 days of great, hands-on practice and good tips on how to pass the exam.  The DP-200 exam was still crazy hard.  I felt like I was guessing on half of it, but I still managed to pass.  We covered DP-201 material in 1 day, and I'm still not sure exactly what we learned other than just reviewing some reference architectures for batch and streaming analytics.

The labs for the training class are available in GitHub and are great to go through:

I also put together some decks with interesting diagrams or notes from each class:

### Azure Data Scientist

* Exams: DP-100  ([Certification info](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/azure-data-scientist.aspx)  -  [Online material](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?roles=data-scientist&resource_type=learning%20path))

This could be interesting, but it looks like it's focused mostly on using Data Science VMs, Python notebooks, and DataBricks to do data science.

We sent a team member to this training and he said it was a waste of time for anyone currently doing data science.  A lot of time was spent on relatively introductory topics like performing linear regression in a Jupyter notebook.

### Azure AI Engineer

* Exams: AI-100  ([Certification info](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/azure-ai-engineer.aspx)  -  [Online material](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?roles=ai-engineer&resource_type=learning%20path))

### Azure Developer

* Exams: AZ-203  ([Certification info](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/azure-developer.aspx)  -  [Online material](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?products=azure&roles=developer&resource_type=learning%20path))
