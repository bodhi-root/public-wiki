## Overview

This class (first offered in the Fall of 2014) provides an introduction to Supply Chain Management with an emphasis on three areas: Demand Forecasting, Inventory Management, and Transportation Planning.  Course material is below.

## My Notes

This class contained the most computations, calculations, and "hard" mathematical applications.  As such, I ended up taking a lot of notes to summarize everything we had learned:

* [Notes - Forecasting.docx](assets/sc1/Notes - Forecasting.docx)
* [Notes - Inventory Management.docx](assets/sc1/Notes - Inventory Management.docx)
* [Notes - Inventory Management - Summarized.docx](assets/sc1/Notes - Inventory Management - Summarized.docx)
