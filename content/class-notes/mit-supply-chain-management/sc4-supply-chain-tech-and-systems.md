title: CTL.SC4 Supply Chain Technology & Systems
---

## Overview

This course was offered from January-March of 2017.  It focused on the technology systems used in supply chains.  The course begin with an introduction to databases.  This included data modeling, database design, and SQL.  It then moved on to machine learning algorithms (utilizing the Orange platform), and then concluded with a study of ERP (Enterprise Retail Planning) systems.

An interactive business simulation (The Fresh Connection) was also used over the course of this class to allow students to demonstrate key concepts learned in all of the classes, as they managed the components and business processes of a simulated supply chain.  The simulation was a bit too complicated (IMHO), but it did provide some interesting ways to visualize and manage supply chain KPIs.  For this reason, it is documented in detail on a separate page.
