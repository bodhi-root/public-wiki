title: "22 QA 725 - Time Series Analysis"
---

This was a graduate course taught at UC, focusing on univariate forecasting.  This ended up being one of the most useful classes I took, as forecast analysis became a big part of what I did when I joined my new company.

My notes from this class are a bit scattered, but here are the ones that matter:

* [Notes - Book.docx](assets/22QA725/Notes - Book.docx) - The book we used in the class was __Forecasting with Univariate Box-Jenkins Models__ by Alan Pankratz
* [Notes - Class.docx](assets/22QA725/Notes - Class.docx) - Some notes from the class. These notes only cover a few weeks.  I was much better at taking notes from the book which covered these topics in more detail.
* [Notes - Class - Transfer Function Models.docx](assets/22QA725/Notes - Class - Transfer Function Models.docx) - Notes on Transfer Function Models.  This goes beyond the univariate methods covered in the book.
* [ADF Explained by Dickey.pdf](assets/22QA725/ADF Explained by Dickey.pdf) - David Dickey explains the Augmented Dickey Fuller test for stationarity.
