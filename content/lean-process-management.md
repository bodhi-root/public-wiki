title: Lean Process Management
---
I'd like to use this space to document various Lean tools, methodologies, and post thoughts or experiences from my own learning.  But first, it might help to define what Lean means to me.

## What is Lean?

According to LEI's [website](http://www.lean.org/WhatsLean/):

> The core idea (of Lean) is to maximize customer value while minimizing waste. Simply, lean means creating more value for customers with fewer resources.

I've always thought that definition was incomplete.  The most exciting part of Lean - at least LEI's approach to Lean - is not the cold optimization and improvement of processes to eliminate waste.  To me that's just context.  The exciting part of Lean is the way that it engages front-line associates in problem-solving and process improvement, potentially unlocking the skills and talents of 400,000 Kroger associates!  I would define Lean as:

> Maximizing customer value and minimizing waste by empowering associates at every level and engaging them in problem-solving and continuous improvement of value-creating processes.

That might be a bit long... and maybe that's headed more towards "The Toyota Way" than just Lean, but any definition of Lean that leaves out the exciting opportunity of changing the very culture of our company is incomplete.  The truth is you cannot have a Lean company if you don't engage front-line associates in continuous improvement.  If process improvement is only handled by a group of dedicated specialists at GO or even at the divisions we will never come close to unlocking the full potential of our workforce and tackling all of the problems that manifest in our stores each day.  These problems can't be solved remotely.  Most of these problems can't even be seen remotely.  It has to be done on the front lines of our company by the people actually doing the work that creates value for our customers. This is what Lean really is to me.  It is a change of culture, an empowerment of store associates, and it could be an enormous competitive advantage for this company.  If we can figure out how to unlock the full potential and the skills of our entire workforce, we will see wide-ranging improvements at a scale and pace that surpasses any of our expectations.

Of course, getting there won't be easy (John Shook estimated that it would take us 100 years).  But we have to start this journey.  Every company is interested in maximizing customer value and minimizing waste - they have to be if they want to survive - and engaging front-line associates is the best way to do this.  In fact, I would say that creating a Lean culture and engaging every associate in problem solving and process improvement is essential to the long-term survival of this company.

## Lean Tools: A Warning

There are several tools that teams use as they practice "Lean".  More than anything, I wanted to use this wiki space to document those tools and keep track of them as a quick reference.  However, there is always concern among Lean practitioners that Lean tools will be used as a substitute for Lean management and Lean culture.  It is easy to see the tools and try to copy these.  It is more difficult to see the management philosophy, practices, and corporate culture that really drive the biggest benefits of Lean.  I'd still like to post notes on these tools as a reference for myself and others, but I have to also post this obligatory warning that the tools themselves are not what make a company or a team Lean.  The true value of Lean is derived from the problem-solving activities that occur at every level of a Lean company.  There are several lean tools that are frequently used in those problem-solving exercises, but we should be careful to avoid thinking that just because Lean tools are being used that a company or a team is in fact practicing Lean.  Doing so would be similar to concluding that a monkey is playing a good game of chess just because we see him sitting in front of a chessboard and playing with the pieces.

## Resources

The resources below have been very helpful in my development and understanding of Lean.  I've also attached notes on some of these books in case anyone is interested in the summary before diving into the whole book.

### Books

__Managing to Learn: Using the A3 Management Process__ (Shook, 2008)

* This book was given to each of the Order Evolution team leaders early on as an instruction in A3 problem solving
* Good book, but a bit slow if you can't get into the fictionalized story.  If you just want the core concepts, see my notes.
* [Link to notes](personal/assets/Managing to Learn - Using the A3 management process - Reference Sheet.docx)

__The Toyota Way: 14 Management Principles from the World's Greatest Manufacturer__ (Liker, 2004)

* Great book!  I need to read this one again... probably a few times.

__Gemba Walks__ (Womack, Shook, 2013).

* Contains essays by Jim Womack, describing insights he's had over decades of consulting work with various companies
* Great ideas and good thought material in here
* [Link to notes](personal/assets/Gemba Walks by Jim Womack - Notes from Dean Sellers.docx) (from Dean Sellers)

__The Machine That Changed the World__ (Womack, Jones, and Roos, 2007)

* A VP at my company once said that if you want to see what our company will be like in 10 years, you should read this book
* I thought the book was dull.  It's too focused on the car industries and doesn't have enough relevant take-aways for really any company.  Read "The Toyota Way" instead.

__Gung Ho! Turn on the People in any Organization__ (Blanchard, 1997)

* A technology VP recommended this book.  I didn't know it was Lean at the time, but that's exactly what this is.
* Lean concepts are introduced as parables and their application in a factory setting is retold:
  * The Spirit of the Squirrel (meaningful work)
  * The Way of the Beaver (empowerment and trust)
  * The Gift of the Goose (cheering and affirmation)
* [Link to notes](personal/assets/Gung Ho.docx)

__It's Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy__ (Abrashoff, 2002)

* Another great recommendation with practical advice on how to empower front-line associates (or sailors), build high-performing teams, and always lead by example
* [Link to notes](personal/assets/It's Your Ship.docx)

__The Oz Principle: Getting Results Through Individual and Organizational Accountability__ (Connors and Smith, 2010)

* Not really Lean... but still a good read
* [Link to notes](personal/assets/The Oz Principle.docx)
