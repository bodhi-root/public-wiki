The key points are to define the problem, identify the root cause of the problem, propose a solution, and then implement and monitor progress of that solution.  As with the problem solving method, it is always good to emphasize that the problem must be properly analyzed, understood, and root causes identified before proposing any solutions.

The more stakeholders that are involved in the development of the A3, the more buy-in you will have from those stakeholders when you do begin to propose countermeasures that may require their support.  As stated in Managing to Learn, an A3 is not really an A3 until it has been shared with someone else.  The A3 also provides something to \\\"push against\\\", a way to challenge someone's thinking and understanding of a problem without attacking the person themselves.  Writing down a problem and documenting a team's understanding of that problem and the reasoning behind their approaches is a valuable tool to encourage clear thinking, true root cause analysis, and to gain effective alignment on proposed countermeasures.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#overview","title":"Overview"},{"url":"#sections-of-an-a3","title":"Sections of an A3","items":[{"url":"#title","title":"Title"},{"url":"#ownerdate","title":"Owner/Date"},{"url":"#background","title":"Background"},{"url":"#current-conditions","title":"Current Conditions"},{"url":"#goals--targets","title":"Goals / Targets"},{"url":"#analysis","title":"Analysis"},{"url":"#proposed-countermeasures","title":"Proposed Countermeasures"},{"url":"#plan","title":"Plan"},{"url":"#follow-up","title":"Follow-up"}]},{"url":"#thoughts","title":"Thoughts"}]},"parent":{"relativePath":"lean-process-management/a3-problem-solving.md"},"frontmatter":{"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null}},"allMdx":{"edges":[{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/class-notes","title":"Class Notes"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology","title":"Computer Technology"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/google-cloud-platform","title":"Google Cloud Platform"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/","title":"Dan's Notes"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/lean-process-management","title":"Lean Process Management"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/personal","title":"About Me"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/class-notes/mit-supply-chain-management","title":"MIT Supply Chain Management"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/class-notes/university-of-cincinnati","title":"University of Cincinnati"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/builder-pattern-java","title":"The Builder Pattern in Java"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/databases","title":"Databases"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/docker-and-containers","title":"Docker and Containers"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/docker","title":"Docker"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/git","title":"Git"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/gpl-beer-clause-license","title":"GPL License with Modified \"Beer Clause\""}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/html-css","title":"HTML and CSS"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/proxy-firewall","title":"Proxy Firewalls"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/r-and-docker","title":"R and Docker"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/react","title":"React Notes"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/regular-expressions","title":"Regular Expression Cheat Sheet"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/computer-technology/tao-of-programming","title":"The Tao of Programming"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/google-cloud-platform/cloud-sql","title":"Cloud SQL"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/google-cloud-platform/cloud-storage-in-gcp","title":"Cloud Storage in GCP"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/google-cloud-platform/coursera-courses-for-gcp","title":"Coursera Courses for GCP"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/google-cloud-platform/gcp-regions","title":"GCP Regions"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/google-cloud-platform/google-cloud-sdk","title":"Google Cloud SDK (gcloud and gsutil)"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/google-cloud-platform/google-container-registry","title":"GCR (Google Container Registry)"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/google-cloud-platform/pubsub-streaming-to-bigquery","title":"PubSub Streaming to BigQuery"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/google-cloud-platform/virtual-private-cloud","title":"Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/lean-process-management/a3-problem-solving","title":"A3 Problem Solving"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/lean-process-management/cause-and-effect-matrix","title":"Cause and Effect Matrix"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/lean-process-management/fishbone-diagram","title":"Fishbone Diagram"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/lean-process-management/five-whys","title":"5 Why's & Issue Trees"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/lean-process-management/mece-diagram","title":"MECE Diagram"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/lean-process-management/six-step-problem-solving","title":"Six Step Problem Solving"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/lean-process-management/tbp-coaching-tool","title":"TBP Coaching Tool"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/lean-process-management/weighted-shortest-job-first","title":"Weighted Shortest Job First"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/lean-process-management/work-stories-and-eracs","title":"Work Stories and ERCS (Mr. Potato Head)"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/personal/quotes","title":"Quotes"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/personal/reading-list","title":"Reading List"}}},{"node":{"fields":{"slug":"/personal/work_rules","title":"Work Rules!
