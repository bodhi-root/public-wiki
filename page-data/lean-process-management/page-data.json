The truth is you cannot have a Lean company if you don't engage front-line associates in continuous improvement.  If process improvement is only handled by a group of dedicated specialists at GO or even at the divisions we will never come close to unlocking the full potential of our workforce and tackling all of the problems that manifest in our stores each day.  These problems can't be solved remotely.  Most of these problems can't even be seen remotely.  It has to be done on the front lines of our company by the people actually doing the work that creates value for our customers. This is what Lean really is to me.  It is a change of culture, an empowerment of store associates, and it could be an enormous competitive advantage for this company.  If we can figure out how to unlock the full potential and the skills of our entire workforce, we will see wide-ranging improvements at a scale and pace that surpasses any of our expectations.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Of course, getting there won't be easy (John Shook estimated that it would take us 100 years).  But we have to start this journey.  Every company is interested in maximizing customer value and minimizing waste - they have to be if they want to survive - and engaging front-line associates is the best way to do this.

More than anything, I wanted to use this wiki space to document those tools and keep track of them as a quick reference.  However, there is always concern among Lean practitioners that Lean tools will be used as a substitute for Lean management and Lean culture.  It is easy to see the tools and try to copy these.  It is more difficult to see the management philosophy, practices, and corporate culture that really drive the biggest benefits of Lean.  I'd still like to post notes on these tools as a reference for myself and others, but I have to also post this obligatory warning that the tools themselves are not what make a company or a team Lean.  The true value of Lean is derived from the problem-solving activities that occur at every level of a Lean company.  There are several lean tools that are frequently used in those problem-solving exercises, but we should be careful to avoid thinking that just because Lean tools are being used that a company or a team is in fact practicing Lean.
