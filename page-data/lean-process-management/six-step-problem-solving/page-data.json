Ben said that the difficult part here is to keep people realistic and get them to focus on small problems.

At this point, everyone is expected to have a legitimate root cause so they can proceed to propose countermeasures and select countermeasures to implement.

We returned to the stores again Wednesday afternoon to do a second root cause investigation and continued this into Thursday.  We didn't have time to implement our countermeasures or measure the results.  Instead, we just presented on Friday what we would like to implement, and then we disbanded.  This was still a great experience, but we did learn that condensing it into 1 week did not work.  It would have been much more helpful to have sufficient time to spend on this and to actually have implemented a solution and measured its success.\"), mdx(\"h2\", null, \"Key Takeaways\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"My favorite part of the class was when Ben Root explained that we were not here to learn to problem solve.  \\\"It would be nice if you learned how to problem solve, but that's not why you're here.  You're here to learn how to teach problem solving to others.\\\"  He emphasized that the 6 step problem solving method was designed to be taught to front-line workers.  It was simpler than \", mdx(\"a\", _extends({\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, {\n    \"href\": \"a3-problem-solving\"\n  }), \"A3 Problem Solving\"), \" (although similar in concept), and intentionally used simple concepts and vocabulary that could be introduced anywhere.  This method was developed for use in factory or production environments, and the real goal is to enable front-line problem solving.  The job of management is then to support this problem solving and to encourage growth and development in newer associates.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Ben also emphasized the danger of introducing problem solving in a company that is not ready for it or totally committed to it.  He asked us what would happen if an eager new associate came up with a solution to a problem, but management then told him he couldn't implement it.  It would likely kill the spirit of innovation and problem solving that you are trying to create.  It is important to introduce problem solving in a controlled way.  Associates coming up with solutions should be encouraged to do so, and management should be very wary of doing anything to discourage this, but it is the job of the problem solver to convince his/her manager that their assessment of the solution and their proposed countermeasure will work.  This is the key to the whole process.  If done correctly, everyone introduced to the problem should be able to follow the reasoning involved.  They should all conclude that the root cause identified is in fact the real problem and that the proposed solution will address this root cause and improve the problem.  If this is the case, everyone should end up being supportive of the solution and willing to give it a try.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The last key take-away involves the description of \\\"Problem Solving Circles\\\" that Ben provided.  At companies that have implemented a Problem Solving culture, continuous problem solving is occurring at all levels of the organization.  In Toyota, every worker participates in problem solving circles and works with a team on some kind of problem.  They present their problem statements, analysis, root causes, and countermeasures are regular meetings in front of management.  This is where management is asked not to critique and not to try and solve any of the team's problems.  Instead, they are just observers.  The most important thing they can do is provide encouragement and to look for problems that are too big for the teams to solve - and where they may need management's involvement to make cross-functional or strategic changes.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","tableOfContents":{"items":[{"url":"#overview","title":"Overview"},{"url":"#key-points","title":"Key Points","items":[{"url":"#1-define-the-problem","title":"1.
