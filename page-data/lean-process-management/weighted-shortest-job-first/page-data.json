It's something used in Agile software development to prioritize work.  I've only learned about this recently, but it does seem quite useful.  The tool is designed to address the biggest trade-off in any project: potential impact versus time to implement.  If you were to list out all the potential improvements your team could make (to your software or your business as a whole), they will likely fall into two categories:\"), mdx(\"ol\", null, mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ol\"\n  }, \"High impact, big projects (that are typically take longer and are most costly/complex to implement)\"), mdx(\"li\", {\n    parentName: \"ol\"\n  }, \"Low impact, small projects (that are typically quicker and simpler to implement)\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"So which should you take on first?  It can be shown that taking a simple approach of either: 1) always doing high-impact jobs first, or 2) always doing the smallest, fastest jobs first, is sub-optimal.  Instead, a team needs a way to take into account both the potential impact of an enhancement and the time/complexity to implement as factors.  This is exactly what WSFJ does.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The benefit of a project is represented as the \\\"Cost of Delay.\\\"  Ideally, this would be the cost (in dollars) for not implementing the change.  As long as this is in common units ($ per day, per week, per month, etc.), we can compare each of our alternatives.  In the SAFe framework, they actually measure this as a number from 1-10, but many argue that it is better to keep this in dollars if at all possible to avoid ambiguity (and I agree).  Then we need to measure the Duration of the project.  Again this can be measured in whatever units (days, weeks, months) are convenient as long as it is the same for all features.  Once again, SAFe measures this on a scale of 1-10, but I agree with those who believe that sticking to actual time measures are better.  Once this is done, we have the two values we need to apply WSJF: the cost of delay and the duration.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"The example below illustrates how to apply WSJF for 3 sample features.

This is actually a good thing and will nudge teams towards being more \\\"agile\\\" (or more \\\"lean\\\") as they direct their work to projects that are both small and high-value.  Larger, more complex requests can still get through, but they will have to have an incredibly high value or cost of delay to do so.  Again, this is a good thing.
