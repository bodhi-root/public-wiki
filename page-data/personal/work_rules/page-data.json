If something is an obstacle to them getting their work done or achieving the agreed upon result, it is a manager's job to break down that obstacle.  The goal of People Operations is to create a workplace where people are encouraged to speak freely, to point out obstacles and remove them, to try new things, and to make data-driven decisions about what works and what doesn't work.  You'll hear Laszlo talk about data-driven experiments a lot.  Google is running hundreds of experiments a year on its own employees.  Little things like changing the placement of healthy food in the breakrooms to incentivize healthier eating or changing the size of plates in the lunchroom (research showed people eat less and feel more full with smaller plates).  Also big things like seeing what happens if we eliminate all managers (they quickly brought them back after admitting that didn't work out so well).

They noticed that their best employees were usually referrals from current employees.  However, the employees eventually used up their social networks and didn't know any other great people to hire.  At that point they turned to the internet and websites liked LinkedIn where you can basically get a database of every IT professional in the country (or in your city, if you prefer) and filter through them with algorithms to find the ones that really stand out.
